# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm
A repository to store the solutions of some of the questions that I have practiced 

This is a repository where I will be posting questions that I have practiced on my pc (apart from online websites like gfg/leetcode).

Some of the names of the files are self-explanatory,some of the file names have the topic which I was practicing and some of the files have
questions written infront of them.

Some of the files may be empty.

Most of the questions have problem statement as comment in the beginning of the file and some also has the video solution links in it.
