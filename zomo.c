// Online food delivery applications such as SWAG[S] and ZOMO[Z] have planned to give their 
// customers some offers, as itâ€™s a month-end. SWAG has intended to provide no offer if the 
// ordered bill is less than 500, 10% offer if the ordered bill is more than 500, 20% offer if the 
// ordered bill is more than 1000, and 30% offer if the ordered bill is more than 1500. ZOMO 
// also has planned to give 5% offer if the ordered bill is less than 500, 10% offer if the ordered 
// bill lies in between 500 to 1200, 15% offer if the ordered bill is more than 1200, and 20% 
// offer if the ordered bill is more than 2000. Help SWAG and ZOMO to generate the bills after 
// applying the offers by applying Problem Solving Framework.
